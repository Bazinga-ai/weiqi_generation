WeiqiGeneration
===============

Just for fun. I'd like to transfer a Weiqi game result into dynamic status and help people to use it efficiently.

I am a fan of Weiqi(围棋) (in English it's called Go) game. It's interesting and smart but of course this isn't right to introduce it.
(if you have interest,try to visit Wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))

The problem is simple. Game result (棋谱) is always shown in match order in a static space so people could only see the final
result at one time. While it will be more useful to show it dynamically in the same order as in the match.

So my aim is to treat a game result as an input image and get real order from it. The job is mainly based on image recognition.

I also show some Weiqi results in src folder and really wish you have fun from it.
